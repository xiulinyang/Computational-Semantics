## Computational-Semantics
This is the semantic tagging project for the course Computational Semantics. 

## Project Motivation
Semantic tagging is a classic problem in Natural Language Processing. How to choose learning algorithms remains to be answered. In this project, we compare the performance of linear classifier and sequence models to see which one performs better with a small, clean but highly imbalanced data set. 

## File Description
There are altogether four files.
